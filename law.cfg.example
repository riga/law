; === Features of the law configuration parser =====================================================

; --- The law home directory -----------------------------------------------------------------------
; The law home directory is the default location of a small number of files and directories that are
; created when working with law. Please refer to the particular configuration options below for more
; information. The law home directory defaults to ``$LAW_HOME`` or ``$HOME/.law``.

; --- Configuration file resolution order ----------------------------------------------------------
; Law configuration files are looked up in a certain order: ``$LAW_CONFIG_FILE``, ``./law.cfg``,
; ``config`` in the law home directory, or ``etc/law/config``. The config parser only reads the
; first existing file. Please also note the optional synchronization with environment variables
; described below.

; --- Inheritance and extensions -------------------------------------------------------------------
; The law configuration can inherit from or can be extended by additional configuration files. See
; the options ``inherit`` and ``extend`` in the ``[core]`` section of the law configuration below.
; The only difference between the two is that options defined in ``inherit`` do not overwrite those
; in the actual config, whereas options of ``extend`` do (options of extended config files are added
; *after* those in the actual config).

; --- Option referencing ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
; To avoid that some configurations are copied to other options (which is required in some cases),
; the law configuration parser supports references. The syntax for references to options in the same
; section is ``&::other_option``, and ``&::other_section::other_option`` for options in other
; sections. None is returned in case a reference cannot be resolved. The same applies to circular
; references.

; --- Environment variable expansion ---------------------------------------------------------------
; Configuration values that contain environment variables are automatically expanded by most getters
; of the law configuration parser, such as ``get_expanded()``, ``get_expanded_int()``, etc. If
; desired, you can avoid this expansion by backslash-escaping characters such as ``$`` or ``~`` to
; ``\$`` or ``\~``.

; --- The "None" value -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Getters of the law configuration parser such as ``get_default()``, get_expanded()``,
; ``get_expanded_int()``, etc., are configured to return a default value (which itself defaults to
; ``None`` (the NoneType)) in case an option is not existing. Sometimes it can be useful to actively
; declare an option as missing. This can be achieved by setting an option to ``"None"`` (string).

; --- Synchronization with environment variables ---------------------------------------------------
; In some scenarios it might be useful to control the value of some options via environment
; variables, for instance, when testing features or prototyping outside of an existing configuration
; file. For these cases, a synchronization mechanism is implemented that reads variables named
; ``LAW__the_section__the_option`` and overwrites the respective option with its value. This is
; enabled by default, but can be configured by the ``sync_env`` option in the ``[core]`` section.

; --- Synchronization with luigi configuration -----------------------------------------------------
; law is built on top of luigi and does not replace it. Therefore, another luigi-specfic
; configuration file is actually required. However, law provides a mechanism to define the luigi
; configuration right within the law configuration file. All sections starting with ``luigi_``, e.g.
; ``[luigi_worker]`` are forwarded to luigi. Environment variable expansion is performed as well.
; This behavior is configurable by the ``sync_luigi_config`` option in the ``[core]`` section.

; do *not* overwrite the ones defined in *this* file. Relative paths are resolved with respect to
; *this* file. Brace expansion, such as ``"myfile{1,2}.cfg"`` to ``"myfile1.cfg", "myfile2.cfg"`` is
; applied.
; Type: ``str``, ``list[str]``, ``None``
; Default: ``None``

; extend

; file. Brace expansion, such as ``"myfile{1,2}.cfg"`` to ``"myfile1.cfg", "myfile2.cfg"`` is
; applied.
; Type: ``str``, ``list[str]``, ``None``
; Default: ``None``

; sync_env
; Description: A boolean flag that decides whether the config should be synchronized with
; environment variables that have the format ``LAW__the_section__the_option``. When ``True``, the
; synchronization takes place after all defaults and config files were read.

; For instance, ``law.workflow.remote: DEBUG`` will set the log level of the logger defined in
; ``law/workflow/remote.py`` to ``"DEBUG"``. Loggers that are not part of the ``law`` namespace are
; supported as well.


; --- modules section ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[modules]

; This section only accepts options without values. They are interpreted as a list of modules that
; are loaded and checked for law tasks classes when ``law index`` is executed. This command creates

; base
; Description: The base path for accessing files on a WLCG storage element. It should with a
; protocol, such as ``"root://"`` or ``"gsiftp://"``, that can be handled by gfal. This value is

; applied.
; Type: ``str``, ``list[str]``, ``None``
; Default: ``None``

; base_stat
; base_exists
; base_chmod
; base_unlink
; base_rmdir
; base_mkdir
; base_listdir
; base_filecopy
; Description: Different base paths for certain file or directory operations. When empty, the value
; of ``base`` is used for that operation. As an example, if you use a base path starting with
; ``"srm://..."``, you might want to choose a different protocol for listdir operations as SRM is
; too inefficient for directory listings (runtime linear to number of items). Brace expansion into a
; list of paths is applied.
; Type: ``str``, ``list[str]``, ``None``

; can differ before considering a file invalid. A negative value means causes all files to be
; considered valid, independent of modification times. This feature might only be useful for file
; systems that are accessible via multiple protocols that might respond to stat requests with
; different timestamps for files that are known to be identical (e.g. large, identical files that
; are provided simultaneously by multiple central storage sites).
; Type: ``float``
; Default: ``1.0``

; cache_file_perm

; used. The value can be expressed by an octal number.
; Type: ``int``
; Default: ``0o0660``

; this option to ``True`` to enfore that FTP connections are closed as soon as possible and remote
; resources are freed properly.
; Type: ``bool``
; Default: ``True``
