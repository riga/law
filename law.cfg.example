; === Features of the law configuration parser =====================================================

; --- The law home directory -----------------------------------------------------------------------
; The law home directory is the default location of a small number of files and directories that are
; created when working with law. Please refer to the particular configuration options below for more
; information. The law home directory defaults to "$LAW_HOME" or "$HOME/.law".

; --- Configuration file resolution order ----------------------------------------------------------
; Law configuration files (like the one you are just reading) are looked up in a certain order:
; $LAW_CONFIG_FILE, ./law.cfg, "config" in the law home directory, or "etc/law/config". The config
; parser only reads the first existing file.

; --- Inheritance and extensions -------------------------------------------------------------------
; The law configuration can inherit from or can be extended by additional configuration files. See
; the options "inherit_configs" and "extend_configs" in the "[core]" section of the law
; configuration below. The only difference between the two is that options defined in
; "inherit_configs" do not overwrite those in the actual config, whereas options of "extend_configs"
; do.

; --- Option referencing ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
; To avoid that some configurations are copied to other options (which is required in some cases),
; the law configuration parser supports references. The syntax for references to options in the same
; section is "&::other_option", and "&::other_section::other_option" for options in other sections.
; None is returned in case a reference cannot be resolved. The same applies to circular references.

; --- Environment variable expansion ---------------------------------------------------------------
; Configuration values that contain environment variables are automatically expanded by most getters
; of the law configuration parser, such as "get_expanded", "get_expanded_int", etc.

; --- The "None" value -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Getters of the law configuration parser such as "get_default", get_expanded", "get_expanded_int",
; etc., are configured to return a default value (which itself defaults to "None" (the NoneType)) in
; case an option is not existing. Sometimes it can be useful to actively declare an option as
; missing. This can be achieved by setting an option to "None" (string).

; --- Synchronization with luigi configuration -----------------------------------------------------
; law is built on top of luigi and does not replace it. Therefore, another luigi-specfic
; configuration file is actually required. However, law provides a mechanism to define the luigi
; configuration right within the law configuration file. All sections starting with "luigi" plus
; underscore, e.g. "[luigi_worker]" are forwarded to luigi. Environment variable expansion is
; performed as well. This behavior is configurable by the "sync_luigi_config" option in the "[core]"
; section.


; === law configuration ============================================================================

; Type: string, list of strings
; Default: None

; extend_configs
; Description: A comma-separated list of files that this config is extended by, i.e., their options
; _do_ overwrite the ones defined in _this_ file. Relative paths are resolved with respect to _this_
; file. Brace expansion, such as "myfile{1,2}.cfg" to "myfile1.cfg, myfile2.cfg" is applied.

; supported as well.


; --- modules section ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
